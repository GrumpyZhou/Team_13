# Project Preparations
In this folder you can find a summary of the project requirements along with a class diagram for the main PHP program. In order to view or modify the class diagram you can use a free tool like for example the yEd Graph Editor, which can be downloaded under the following URL: http://www.yworks.com/en/products/yfiles/yed/ .

The contents of this folder will be updated according to changes with the ongoing project.
