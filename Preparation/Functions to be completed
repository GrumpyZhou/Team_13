TransactionHandler:
can not call 
require_once('../Model/TransactionHandler.php') maybe something due to the pdf module;

Where is the user_id to call the function transactionHistory
how to use the returned dataArray 

MoneyTransferHandler:
transferMoney($source, $receiver, $amount, $tan, $tanId) what is the $source is it the user's iban?
	source and receiver are the user ids
and  
parseBatchFile($senderId, $filePath, $tanId, $tan) what is $filePath? Is it the input file 's val?
	the name of the batch file should be $senderId, the file should be placed in the Upload directory which is inside EasyBanking


Employee.php:
 miss the include_once of Account.php
 Test shows I can not get the variables of Employee class....
 
 
RequestHandler:
 getOpenRequests($accounts) and others to be used should be static?
  you can get an instance of the requesthandler with getInstance but I can also make the methods static if you prefer that
 approve&deny Request : what is id field? it can be id but not good for display so maybe I make it a hidden field so give me the id together with email.
  id is the key of the users or the transactions table
Customer DB:
Still miss interface to get the user information by giving only email or iban;
