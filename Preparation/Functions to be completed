TransactionHandler:
can not call 
require_once('../Model/TransactionHandler.php') maybe something due to the pdf module;
	I was able to call it not sure why that is happening. From which file do you try to call it?

Where is the user_id to call the function transactionHistory
	it is the id in the users table
how to use the returned dataArray
	the dataArray contains the date, receiverIBAN and amount of all the transactions, you should be able to just loop through the array and use that data

MoneyTransferHandler:
transferMoney($source, $receiver, $amount, $tan, $tanId) what is the $source is it the user's iban?
	source and receiver are the user ids
and  
parseBatchFile($senderId, $filePath, $tanId, $tan) what is $filePath? Is it the input file 's val?
	the name of the batch file should be $senderId, the file should be placed in the Upload directory which is inside EasyBanking


Employee.php:
 miss the include_once of Account.php
 Test shows I can not get the variables of Employee class....
 
 
RequestHandler:
 getOpenRequests($accounts) and others to be used should be static?
  you can get an instance of the requesthandler with getInstance but I can also make the methods static if you prefer that
 approve&deny Request : what is id field? it can be id but not good for display so maybe I make it a hidden field so give me the id together with email.
  id is the key of the users or the transactions table
Customer DB:
Still miss interface to get the user information by giving only email or iban;
